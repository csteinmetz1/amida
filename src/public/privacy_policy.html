		<h3>Anonymity</h3>
		<p>
			All data collected through <strong>amida</strong> is kept completely anonymous. 
			Upon beginning the survey a unique identifier is created for the user.
			This identifier is used to anonymously track the user's data, but contains no link to their actual identity.
			Therefore, this data does not fall within the scope of the GDPR.
			It should be noted, if a user completes the survey and later wishes to have their data removed, this will not be possible.
			By agreeing to begin the survey the user waives their right to request their data not be included in the database.
		</p>

		<h3>Data Usage</h3>
		<p>
			The data collected with this interface is intended for use within the context of academic research and may appear in scientific publications.
			In addition, a collection of data gathered with this interface may be published online for use by other researchers.
			This should pose no concern as all data will be completely anonymized.
			This data may be kept for an indefinite length of time.
